# LK-Renderer
We are proud to present you an alternate Renderer for Blender.
It basically works the same way rendering does in the usual blender programm but it does not displays your render “live”, which might result in a faster render.

How it works:
You select a Blender version of your choice which you like (ideally the one you made your .blend with), then it is downloaded once (you don't have to download it again later), select your .blend file, choose between an animation or single frame render and hit render. After that a window will pop wich renders the image(s) and there you go!

## Mac OS X version
I am proud to present my Mac OS X port of the LK-Renderer, with Awesomeness(MacVersion) ≥ Awesomeness(WindowsVersion) - sorry for bragging. See the _osx_ folder for the code, I will provide you with a .app download soon.
